Question 1 

-> Cnum should be "primary key" because that needs to be unique for each customers

Question 2

-> "Rating" column is 4th of customer table

Question 3

->  rows are called as records and columns are called as fields

Question 4

->When you INSERT a table, wherever MYSQL finds the free space in the DB Server HD, it will store the row there
When you SELECT from a table, the searching is sequential 
When you SELECT from a table, the order of rows in the output depends on the row address; it will always be in ascending order of row address
Once you INSERT a row, the row address is constant
When you UPDATE a row, if the row length is increasing and the free space is not available, then the entire row is moved to some other address on the DB Server HD
Later when you SELECT from the table, you may see that row at some other location
Its only in the case of VARCHAR that the row length may increase or decrease
Hence it is not possible to see the first 'N' rows of a table, or the last 'N' rows of a table
this is common for all RDBMS
